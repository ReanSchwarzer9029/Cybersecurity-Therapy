### Information Security Governance
- Set of responsibilities and actions exercised by Board of Management of an organisation
- Goal: **Align** strategic direction of IS activities with business strategy
	- Ensure that IS risks **managed adequately**
	- Use resources efficiently to **achieve organisation's objectives**
	- Ensure that **resources and processes properly protected**

### Classical Information Security Objectives
| Objective       | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confidentiality | Ensure information not disclosed or made available to unauthorised individuals, entities or processes                                                                         |
| Integrity       | Protect information and information systems from unauthorised changes                                                                                                         |
| Availability    | Ensures information or assets is accessible and usable whenever demanded by unauthorised authority                                                                            |
| Accountability  | Ensures that actions of individual can be traced back to that individual<br>Enables organisations to determine who has executed what action, how and when was action executed |
| Non-repudiation | Ensures individual or entity cannot deny previous commitments or actions<br>(Can be achieved through digital signatures)                                                                                                      |


### Risk Assessment
- Should be undertaken to **identify physical, environmental security threats**
- Determine appropriate associated controls to be implemented in organisation to counter threats
- When performing risk assessment, complexity and risk level associated with electronic information assets and facilities environmental systems need to be considered
- Should be on top of traditional physical security such as security guards, looks and fences

### Risk Monitoring 
- Management should ensure organisation's risk profile is updated accordingly
- Can be achieved through periodic risk assessments, security reviews (penetration testing) and audits
- Organisation should be proactive in risk monitoring and acting to response to new risks in timely manner
- Use of indicators in larger organisations can help monitor status of risks more effectively
- Address this element by including:
	- Training and awareness programme
	- Communication of IS policies, standards and procedures

### Vulnerabilities
> Weaknesses that can be exploited in **People, Processes and Technology**
> - If exploited, can result in damage or harm

- Examples of vulnerabilities:
	- **Unpatched** software and/or operating systems
	- **Unencrypted** transmission of data
	- **Non-compliance** or enforcement of policies
	- **Weak** protection or poor network design

### Information Security Risk Management
> **Risk treatment** involves prioritisation, evaluation and implementation of appropriate risk-reducing  controls recommended based on risk assessment

- Risk can be treated based on following options:

| Option       | Explanation                                                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Avoidance    | Completely avoided risk by eliminating the root cause of consequences   |
| Mitigation   | Reduce or lower the risk by implementing appropriate controls           |
| Transference | Transfer risk to another party e.g. purchase of insurance               |
| Acceptance   | Accept residual risk after employing and exhausting first three options |

### Information Classification
- Process of classifying data or information assets 

> **Aim**: Prioritise effort and resources required to protect data and information assets
- Organisation should assess relative importance of various information systems based on following criteria:
	- Nature of function
	- Criticality of information
	- Sensitivity of information
	- Information asset value
- Organisations usually classify information in terms of confidentiality
- **Typical system of levels of confidentiality:**
	- Confidential (senior management)
	- Restricted (most employees)
	- Internal (all employees)
	- Public Information (everyone)

- **Issues of information classification:**

| Issue                    | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Multiple Classifications | Comply with multiple laws and regulations                                                                                                  |
| Internal Resistance      | Face internal resistance from some individuals when engaging them to begin discovery                                                       |
| Over-classification      | Occurs when security classification mapped to access controls which must not happen when only one person is classifying information assets |
| Coverage                 | Will never really show whether or not all information assets have been discovered                                                                                                                                           |

### Acceptable Use Policy (UAP)
- AUP details permitted system uses, user activities and consequences of non-compliance
- Users often required to agree to UAP before being granted access rights to a system
- **Human Resource Departments** need to define and enforce Acceptable User Policy
- Outline standards on how employees may use Internet or link device that touches organization's IT infrastructure

### Cyber Hygiene
- Best practices:
	- Installing antivirus software to scan for viruses
	- Using firewalls to stop unauthorized users from getting information
	- Restrict privileged access to authorised personnel
	- Updating apps, web browsers, and OSs on all devices regularly
	- Keeping hard drives clean by reformatting and wiping them
	- Changing passwords and using multifactor authentication
	- Review server and application port settings
	- Conduct security awareness training
