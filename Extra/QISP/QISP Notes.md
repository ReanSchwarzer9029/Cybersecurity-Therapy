- Set of responsibilities and actions exercised by Board of Management of an organisation
- Goal: **Align** strategic direction of IS activities with business strategy
	- Ensure that IS risks **managed adequately**
	- Use resources efficiently to **achieve organisation's objectives**
	- Ensure that **resources and processes properly protected**

### Classical Information Security Objectives
| Objective       | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confidentiality | Ensure information not disclosed or made available to unauthorised individuals, entities or processes                                                                         |
| Integrity       | Protect information and information systems from unauthorised changes                                                                                                         |
| Availability    | Ensures information or assets is accessible and usable whenever demanded by unauthorised authority                                                                            |
| Accountability  | Ensures that actions of individual can be traced back to that individual<br>Enables organisations to determine who has executed what action, how and when was action executed |
| Non-repudiation | Ensures individual or entity cannot deny previous commitments or actions<br>(Can be achieved through digital signatures)                                                                                                      |


### Risk Assessment
- Should be undertaken to **identify physical, environmental security threats**
- Determine appropriate associated controls to be implemented in organisation to counter threats
- When performing risk assessment, complexity and risk level associated with electronic information assets and facilities environmental systems need to be considered
- Should be on top of traditional physical security such as security guards, looks and fences

### Risk Monitoring 
- Management should ensure organisation's risk profile is updated accordingly
- Can be achieved through periodic risk assessments, security reviews (penetration testing) and audits
- Organisation should be proactive in risk monitoring and acting to response to new risks in timely manner
- Use of indicators in larger organisations can help monitor status of risks more effectively
- Address this element by including:
	- Training and awareness programme
	- Communication of IS policies, standards and procedures

### Vulnerabilities
> Weaknesses that can be exploited in **People, Processes and Technology**
> - If exploited, can result in damage or harm

- Examples of vulnerabilities:
	- **Unpatched** software and/or operating systems
	- **Unencrypted** transmission of data
	- **Non-compliance** or enforcement of policies
	- **Weak** protection or poor network design

### Information Security Risk Management
> **Risk treatment** involves prioritisation, evaluation and implementation of appropriate risk-reducing  controls recommended based on risk assessment

- Risk can be treated based on following options:

| Option       | Explanation                                                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Avoidance    | Completely avoided risk by eliminating the root cause of consequences   |
| Mitigation   | Reduce or lower the risk by implementing appropriate controls           |
| Transference | Transfer risk to another party e.g. purchase of insurance               |
| Acceptance   | Accept residual risk after employing and exhausting first three options |

### Information Classification
- Process of classifying data or information assets 

> **Aim**: Prioritise effort and resources required to protect data and information assets
- Organisation should assess relative importance of various information systems based on following criteria:
	- Nature of function
	- Criticality of information
	- Sensitivity of information
	- Information asset value
- Organisations usually classify information in terms of confidentiality
- **Typical system of levels of confidentiality:**
	- Confidential (senior management)
	- Restricted (most employees)
	- Internal (all employees)
	- Public Information (everyone)

- **Issues of information classification:**

| Issue                    | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Multiple Classifications | Comply with multiple laws and regulations                                                                                                  |
| Internal Resistance      | Face internal resistance from some individuals when engaging them to begin discovery                                                       |
| Over-classification      | Occurs when security classification mapped to access controls which must not happen when only one person is classifying information assets |
| Coverage                 | Will never really show whether or not all information assets have been discovered                                                                                                                                           |

### Acceptable Use Policy (UAP)
- AUP details permitted system uses, user activities and consequences of non-compliance
- Users often required to agree to UAP before being granted access rights to a system
- **Human Resource Departments** need to define and enforce Acceptable User Policy
- Outline standards on how employees may use Internet or link device that touches organization's IT infrastructure

### Cyber Hygiene
- Best practices:
	- Installing antivirus software to scan for viruses
	- Using firewalls to stop unauthorized users from getting information
	- Restrict privileged access to authorised personnel
	- Updating apps, web browsers, and OSs on all devices regularly
	- Keeping hard drives clean by reformatting and wiping them
	- Changing passwords and using multifactor authentication
	- Review server and application port settings
	- Conduct security awareness training

### Different Security Architecture Framework
> NOTE: Most common answer is **SABSA**

#### O-ESA
> **O-ESA** -> Open-Enterprise Security Architecture (Reference architecture)

- Contains information about on IS governance, security principles and technology components and services needed in security architecture

### O-SCOA
> **O-SCOA** -> Secure Collaboration-Oriented Architecture (IS framework)

- Specifies requirements for secure design of enterprise IT architectures supporting deperimeterised operations
- Specifies all essential components required for architecting secure systems

### OSA
> **OSA** -> Open Security Architecture 

- Provides security architecture patterns
- Controls catalogue and threat catalogue

### SABSA
- Enterprise security architecture framework
- Method integrated with TOGAF Enterprise Architecture framework and methodology
- Provides guide to integrating risk and security management into enterprise architecture

### Different IS Governance Framework

#### COBIT
> **COBIT** -> Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology
- Framework for governing and managing enterprise IT to support organisations in the development, implementation and continuous improvement and monitoring of good IT-related governance and management practices

#### COSO
> **COSO** -> Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission
- Guidance to Executive Management and governance entities on the following critical aspects: 
	- organisational governance
	- business ethics
	- internal control
	- enterprise risk assessment
	- fraud
	- financial reporting

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- To protect individuals fundamental rights and freedoms
	- Particularly their right to protection to their personal data
- Key privacy and data protection requirements of GDPR include the following:
	- Requiring consent of subjects for data processing
	- Anonymizing collect data to protect privacy
	- Providing data breach notifications
	- Safely handling transfer of data across borders
	- Requiring certain companies to appoint data protection officer to oversee GDPR compliance

> **Important to note:**
> - GDPR applies to each member state of the EU aiming to create more consistent protection of consumer and personal data across EU countries
> - Any company that sells goods and services to EU citizens regardless of location is subject to regulations

- EU mandates mandate baseline set of standards for companies that handle EU citizen's data to better safeguard processing and movement of citizen personal data

## Physical Security, Business Continuity and Audit
> **Definition**
> - Physical and environmental security provide protection for for physical assets and infrastructure of organisation
> - Extend from buildings, information processing facilities, information systems and storage facilities to mission critical or sensitive data

- IS is important to organisational needs
	- Ensures that information resources are protected and available to organisation when required
- **Layer Defence Model**
	- Physical controls should work together in tiered architecture
	- Level of security increases as attacker moves into the layers
	- Prevents or delays attackers from gaining access to assets

### Business Continuity Management (BCM)
> BCM helps organisation establish resilient response framework to tackle identified threats and potential impact

#### Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
- Management level examination of impact qualitatively and quantitatively if potential disruption of business operations and processes occur\

**Objectives:**
- Assist management in understanding impact associated with possible disruptions
- Identify and prioritise critical business processes, applications and systems
- Analyse the impact
- Determine recovery objectives

### System Audit Plan
> **Goals**:
> - Ensure that IT controls protect corporate assets, ensure data integrity and operate effectively to achieve organisation's goals and objectives

- Information Systems Audit Strategy
- Formalise Audit Plan
- Type of IS Audit
- Evaluation of Findings
- Communicating Audit Results
- Follow-up Activities
- Audit Documentation

**Objectives:**
- Evaluation of organisation processes and information systems are in place
- Identify gaps in IT system and management
- Identify risks to information assets
- Ensure compliance with IT specific laws policies and standards
- <u>Important to develop audit programme for target audit areas</u>

## Security Architecture and Engineering

### Cryptography
**Objectives:**
- Ensure confidentiality of information
- Protect integrity of information against alteration
- Authenticate source of information
- Prevent unauthorised access to data or cipher text
- Prevent repudiation by sending and receiving parties during message exchange

#### Key Management Principles
- Should be automated to eliminate manual steps that are prone to human error
- No key should appear in clear outside of cryptographic devices to ensure secrecy of key
- Key must be randomly chosen from entire key space to eliminate pattern in which key is chosen
- Key Encrypting Key (KEK) must be separate from Data Encrypting Key (DEK)
	- Key used to encrypt keys should not be used to encrypt data
	- Exposure and use should be limited
	- KEKs should be stored very securely and separate from DEKs
	- KEKs can be organised into a hierarchy (master KEK used to encrypt, intermediate KEKs stored encrypted only)
	- Keys with long life must be used sparsely to minimise exposure and reduce possibility of attack

#### Key Management Interoperability (KMIP)
> KIMP standardises the communication between cryptographic clients that consume keys and key management systems that create and manage those keys

- Leverages other standards like TLS whenever possible and focuses on problem of interoperable messages between cryptographic clients and key management systems
- Allows organisations to deploy single enterprise key management infrastructure to manage all keys in organisation
- Allows specific key management environments to communicate with other key management systems outside their environments
