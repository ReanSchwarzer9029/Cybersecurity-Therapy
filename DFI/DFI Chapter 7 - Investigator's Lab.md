3. Maintain fiscal responsibility
4. Enforce ethical standards among lab staff
5. Plan updates for lab
6. Establish and promote quality
	- Assurance processes
	- Ensure that staff know what to do when case arrives
7. Set reasonable production schedules
	- Based on existing resources
8. Estimate how many cases investigator can handle
	- Certain cases can be longer due to nature of case
9. Estimate when to expect preliminary and final results
10. Create and monitor lab policies for staff
11.  Provide safe and secure workplace for staff and evidence

### Duties of Staff Members
1. Have **knowledge** and **training**
	- Hardware and software
	- OS and file types
	- Deductive reasoning
	- Work reviewed regularly by lab manager to ensure quality of work is maintained
2. Check ASCLD site for online manual and information

## Lab Budget Planning
- Break down expenses into:
	- daily
	- quarterly
	- annual
- Use past investigation expenses to extract expected future costs
- Expenses for lab:
	- hardware
	- software
	- facility space
	- training personnel
- Estimate number of computer cases lab expects to examine
- Take note of changes in technology
- Use statistics to determine type of computer crimes more likely to occur
	- Better estimate resources needed
- When setting up lab for private company, check the following:
	- Hardware and software inventory
	- Problems reported last year
	- Future development in computing technology
	- Time management is major issue when choosing software and hardware to purchase

## Acquiring Certification and Training
- Update skills through relevant training
	- Thoroughly research requirements, costs, acceptability in area of employment
	- Address minimum skills for conducting investigations at various levels
	- <u>Examples:</u>
		- **International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists (IACIS)**
			- Those who pass the test are Certified Forensic Computer Examiner (CFCE)
		- **AccessData Certified Examiner Certification (ACE)**
		- **EC-Council**
		- **SANS** - Expensive
		- **Defence Cyber Investigations Training Academy (DCITA)**

## Determining Physical Requirements for Computer Forensics Lab
- Lab should be secure so that evidence not lost, corrupted or destroyed
- Provide safe and secure physical environment
- Keep inventory control of assets

### Identifying Lab Security Needs
- **Secure facility**
	- Should preserve the integrity of data
- <u>Minimum requirements:</u>
	- Small room with true floor-to-ceiling walls
	- Door access with locking mechanism
	- Secure container
	- Visitor's log
- Brief staff about security policy

### Conducting High-Risk Investigations
- Demands more security than minimum lab requirements
- **TEMPEST facilities**:
	- Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) proofed
		- Leaking signal can be used to reconstruct information 
	- Stops information systems from leaking through emanations
		- Including unintentional radio/electrical signals, sounds and vibrations
	- Expensive
		- Can use low-emanation workstations instead

### Evidence Containers
- Known as evidence lockers
	- Must be secure so that no unauthorized person can easily access evidence

- <u>Recommendations</u>:
	1. Locate them in restricted area
	2. Limited number of authorized persons accessing the containers
	3. Maintain records on who authorized to access container
	4. Containers should remain locked when not in use

> **If combination locking system used:**
> - Provide same level of security for combination as for container's contents
> - Destroy any previous combinations after setting up new ones
> - Allows only authorized personnel to change lock combinations
> - Change combinations every six months when required
> 
> **If keyed padlock used:**
> - Appoint a key custodian
> 	- Responsible for distributing keys
> - Stamp sequential numbers for each duplicate key
> - Maintain <u>registry listing</u> which key is assigned to which authorized person
> - Conduct **monthly audit**
> - Take inventory of all keys
> - Place keys in lockable container
> - Maintain same level of security for keys as evidence containers
> - Change locks and keys annually

- Container should be made of steel with internal cabinet or external padlock
- Acquire media safe if possible
	- Designed to protect electronic media 
- Build evidence storage room in lab
- Keep evidence log
	- Update it every time evidence container opened and closed

### Facility Maintenance
- Immediately repair physical damages
- Escort cleaning crew as they work
- Minimize the risk of static electricity
	- Antistatic pads
	- Clean floor and carpets - minimize dust
- Maintain two separate trash containers
	- Materials unrelated to investigation
	- Sensitive materials
- When possible, hire specialized companies for disposing sensitive materials

### Physical Security Needs
- Enhance security by settings security policies
- Enforce policy
	- Maintain sign-in log for visitors
		- Anyone not assigned to lab is a <u>visitor</u>
		- Escort visitors at all times
	- Use visible/audible indicators that visitor is inside the premises
		- Visitor badge
	- Install intrusion alarm system
	- Hire guard force for lab

## Auditing Digital Forensics Lab
> - Ensure proper enforcing of policies

- Audits should include the inspecting the following facility components and practices:
	- Ceiling, floor, roof, exterior walls of lab
	- Doors and door locks
	- Visitor logs
	- Evidence container logs
	- Secure all evidence that is not being process in forensic workstation at the end of every workday

## Determining Floor Plans for Digital Forensics Labs
- Factors affecting configuration of work area
	- Budget
	- Amount of floor space available
	- Number of computers assigned to each computing investigator
- <u>Ideal configuration:</u>
	- Two forensic workstations
		- 1 workstation for 2-3 cases a month
	- One non-forensic workstation with Internet access

### Selecting Basic Forensic Workstation
- Depends on budget and needs
- Use less powerful workstations for mundane tasks
- Use multipurpose workstations for resource-heavy analysis tasks

### Selecting Workstations for a Lab
- Identify environment dealt with:
	- Hardware platform
	- Operating system
		- Windows or Mac
- Police labs have more diverse needs for computing investigation tools
	- Might need legacy systems and software to match what is used in the community
- Small local police department might have one multipurpose forensic workstation and 1-2 general-purpose workstations
- Lightweight mobile forensic workstation can be created with just the following:
	- Laptop PC with FireWire
