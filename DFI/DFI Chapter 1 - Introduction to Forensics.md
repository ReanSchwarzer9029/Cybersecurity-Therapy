## Overview of Digital Forensics
> **Define digital forensics**:
> - Applications of computer science and investigative procedures for legal purposes

- Involves: 
	- proper search authority,
	- chain of custody, 
	- validation with mathematics, 
	- use of validated tools, 
	- repeatability, 
	- possible expert presentation

- Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) created to ensure consistency in federal proceedings 
- FBI Computer Analysis and Response Team (CART) formed in 1984 to handle cases involving digital evidence 
- CART teamed up with the Department of Defence Computer Forensics Laboratory (DCFL) in the late 1990s

## Case Law
* Existing laws cannot keep up with the rate of technological advancement
* When statutes do not exist, case law used by allowing legal counsel to apply previous similar cases to the current one to handle ambiguity in laws
* Examiners must be familiar with recent court rulings on search and seizure in electronic environment

## How to Develop Digital Forensics Resources?
* Supplement knowledge by developing and maintaining contact with computing, network and investigative professionals
* Join computer groups in both public and private sectors e.g., Computer Technology Investigators Network (CTIN)
* Consult outside experts

## Preparing for Digital Forensics
Two categories of investigations:
* Public-sector investigations
* Private-sector investigations

| Public-Sector Investigations                                                        | Private-Sector Investigations                                                                       |

| Involve government agencies responsible for criminal investigations and prosecution | Involve private companies and lawyers addressing company policy violations and litigation disputes. |

### Legal Process
1. Criminal investigation starts when someone finds evidence or witness of a crime
2. Police interviews the complainant and writes report about crime
3. Report is processed and management decides to start an investigation or log information in police blotter (historical database of previous crimes)
4. **Digital Evidence First Responder**
	- Arrives at incident scene, assesses the situation and takes precautions to acquire and preserve evidence 
5. **Digital Evidence Specialist**
	* Has the skill to analyse data and determine when another analyst should be called for assistance.
6. **Affidavit**
	* Sworn statement of support of facts or evidence about a crime
	* Include exhibits that support the allegation

## Private-Sector Investigations
* Businesses strive to minimize or eliminate litigation
* They can reduce the risk of litigation:
	* By publishing and maintaining policies that are easy for employees to read and follow
* **Acceptable Use Policy** -> defines rules for using company computers and networks
* **Line of Authority** â†’ states who have legal right to initiate an investigation and who can take possession of evidence and have access to evidence
* Businesses can avoid litigation by displaying a warning banner on computer screens
	* Inform the user that organization reserves the right to inspect computer systems and network traffic at will
	* Most common types of situations:
	    * Abuse or misuse of computer assets
	    * E-mail abuse
	    * Internet abuse

## Maintaining Professional Conduct
* Investigators must exhibit highest level of professional behaviour at all times
	* Maintain objectivity
	* Maintain credibility by maintaining  confidentiality
* Investigators should attend training to stay current with latest technical changes

## Preparing a Digital Forensics Investigation
* Objective of a Digital Forensics Investigator is to gather evidence to prove that a suspect committed a crime or violated a company policy
* Collect evidence that can be offered in court or at corporate inquiry
	* Investigate suspect's computer
	* Preserve evidence on a different computer
* **Chain of custody**
	* Route evidence takes from time it is found until case is closed or goes to court

## Computer Crime
* Computers may contain information that helps law enforcement determine:
	* Chain of events leading to the crime
	* Evidence that can lead to a conviction
	* Law enforcement officers should follow proper procedure when acquiring evidence as evidence can be easily altered by overeager investigator

* Potential challenge: information on hard disks can be password protected so forensics tools needed for investigation

## Company Violation
* Employees misusing resources can cost companies millions of dollars
* Examples of misuse:
	* Surfing the internet
	* Sending personal emails
	* Using company computers for personal uses

## Systemic Approach
<u>Steps:</u>
1. Make initial assessment about type of case you are investigating
2. Determine preliminary design or approach to case
3. Create a detailed checklist
4. Determine resources needed
5. Obtain and copy evidence drive
