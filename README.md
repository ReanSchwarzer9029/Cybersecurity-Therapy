# Cybersecurity Therapy
Welcome to Cybersecurity Therapy, your place of comfort after another typical day of BS from DISM! You can cry, weep and mug in my little safe repository where I sacrifice my blood, sweat, tears (and sleep :D) to create notes that are so damn useful for my own survival in DISM (and to get a decent GPA).

## Q: What modules are featured here?
### ST0503 Back-End Web Development (BED)
Aim to equip students with the skill in developing database driven web application. Students will learn about server-side programming and be able to create-database-driven web applications using a scripting language and programming frameworks.

### ST2514 Digital Forensics and Investigation (DFI)
Equips students with the fundamental concepts and techniques of computer and mobile forensics. Students will learn to acquire, analyse and present both computer and mobile data as evidence. This module will cover tools and techniques of computer and mobile forensics, data recovery, imaging and storage of electronic evidence.

### ST2515 Secure Coding (SC)
This module covers the concepts and fundamentals of secure coding principles, and techniques to prevent security vulnerabilities in web applications. Through a series of hacking and coding practical exercises, students will learn the implications of insecure code in applications and subsequently how to defend their web applications against potential hackers by coding securely.

### ST251Z Ethical Hacking and Defences (EHD)
Provides students with a foundation on network protocols, network security, secure coding and penetration testing to protect computer resources. Students are taught offensive and defensive skills for the organisationâ€™s wired and wireless networks in order to protect important assets against hackers.

### ST2610

## Q: Where TF are your Year 1 Notes?
Sorry, I cannot include them in this repository as I wrote them on paper when I myself was Year 1 and I did not know that Markdown exists until Year 2 (bruh moment)
I would remake my Year 1 notes here, but why TF would I do that? It doesn't make sense!

## Q: What app do you use to make your notes?
I use Obsidian, a markdown editing app. I use an extension in Obsidian to auto-push my commits over to this therapy repo :)

## Other Notes
As much as I love this place to be a sanctuary for most DISM students, it should **NOT** be your only source of revision! My notes are useful, yes, but you should always cross-reference slides and other learning sources from school as the syllabus of DISM may change from time to time (heck, that one module might be gone in the future :copium:)

## Tips
Study notes are useful, but useless if you can't make good use of them! Lemme share with you some tips on how to ace the killer exams DISM lecturers love to set :D

### Consistency
Be consistent! Set aside some time every week to make notes for a chapter because everything is so fast paced with new topics being covered every week, so there is definitely no time to revisit them! If you can do this, last minute revision will not be an issue for you since your consistency has allowed you to make notes to cover all the topics before revising for exams! All you would be left to do is to look through your perfectly made notes created every week and create a summary to wrap everything up for exam preparations!

> P.S. I learnt it the hard way ;-;

### Memorising
Humanities people are too good at memorising, so those who are good at humanities would have a good time remembering all the cancerous definitions and terms.

Of course DISM students being DISM students, most aren't good to memorise but suck it up you are gonna have to anyways (anything for a 
decent GPA right). 

My style of memorising:
1. Make important terms eye-catching or stand out (bolding, underlining, highlighting, whatever catches your attention)
2. Underline points that are definitely important to include in your exam answers!
3. Write a summary for each chapter featuring important terms or definitions that you feel will most likely come out during exams. You can also include pointers from the focus areas depending on your module

## Conclusion
With that, have fun dying in DISM (SOC biomedical science :copium:) and happy mugging! All the best for whatever exams you are dreading and I hope you can get a decent GPA from my notes (and other notes, of course) ;-;
