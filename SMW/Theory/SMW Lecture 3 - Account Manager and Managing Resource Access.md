## User Account Management
- **Default accounts:**
	- Administrator
	- Guest
- Accounts can be set up in <u>two general environments</u>:
	- **Local User Accounts**
		- Accounts that are set up via a stand-alone server that does not have an Active Directory
	- **Domain User Accounts**
		- Accounts that are set up in a domain when the Active Directory is installed
- When accounts are created in the domain through Active Directory, these accounts can be used to access any server or resource in the domain
---
- New accounts are created by first installing the *Local Users and Groups* MMC snap-in for stand-alone serve that do not use the Active Directory
