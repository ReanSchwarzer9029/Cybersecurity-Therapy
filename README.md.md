# Cybersecurity Therapy
Welcome to Cybersecurity Therapy, your place of comfort after another typical day of BS from DISM! You can cry, weep and mug in my little safe repository where I sacrifice my blood, sweat, tears (and sleep :D) to create notes that are so damn useful for my own survival in DISM (and to get a decent GPA).

## Q: Where TF are Year 1 Notes
Sorry I do not have them, as I wrote them on paper when I myself was Year 1 and I did not know Markdown exists until like Year 2 (bruh)
I would remake my Year 1 notes here, but why TF would I do that? It doesn't ma

## Q: What app do you use to make your notes?
I use Obsidian, a markdown editing app. I use an extension in Obsidian to auto-push my commits over to this therapy repo :)

## Other Notes
As much as I love this place to be a sanctuary for most DISM students, it should **NOT** be your only source of revision! My notes are useful, yes, but you should always cross-reference slides and other learning sources from school as the syllabus of DISM may change from time to time (heck, that one module might be gone in the future :copium:)

## Tips
Study notes are useful, but useless if you can't make good use of them! Lemme share with you some tips on how to ace the killer exams DISM lecturers love to set :D

### Memorising
Humanities people are too good at memorising, so those who are good at humanities would have a good time remembering all the cancerous definitions and terms.

Of course DISM students being DISM students, most aren't good to memorise but suck it up you are gonna have to anyways (anything for a 
decent GPA right). 

My style of memorising:
1. Make important terms eye-catching or stand out (bolding, underlining, highlighting, whatever catches your attention)
2. Underline points that are definitely important to include in your exam answers!
3. Write a summary for each chapter featuring important terms or definitions that you feel will most likely come out during exams. You can also include pointers from the focus areas depending on your module

## Conclusion
With that, have fun dying in DISM (SOC biomedical science :copium:) and happy mugging! All the best for whatever exams you are dreading and I hope you can get a decent GPA from my notes (and other notes, of course) ;-;
