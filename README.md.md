# Cybersecurity Therapy
Welcome to Cybersecurity Therapy, your place of comfort after another typical day of BS from DISM! You can cry, weep and mug in my little safe space

## Q: Where TF are Year 1 Notes
Sorry I do not have them, as I wrote them on paper when I myself was Year 1 and I did not know Markdown exists until like Year 2 (bruh)

## Q: What app do you use to make your notes?
I use Obsidian, a markdown editing app. I use an extension in Obsidian to auto-push my commits over to this therapy repo :)

## Other Notes
As much as I love this place to be a sanctuary for most DISM students, it should **NOT** be your only source of revision! My notes are useful, yes, but you should always reference slides and other learning sources from school as well as the syllabus of DISM may change from time to time (heck, that one module)
