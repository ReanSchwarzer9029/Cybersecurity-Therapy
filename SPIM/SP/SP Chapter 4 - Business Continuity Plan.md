## Cyber Resiliency
> Organisation's capability to withstand negative impacts due to known, predictable, unknown, unpredictable, uncertain and unexpected threats from activities in cyberspace

### Beyond Risk Management
- **Risk management** focuses on achieving security through management and control of known risks
- Rapid evolution of opportunities and risks in cyberspace is outpacing this approach and it no longer provides the protection needed for an organisation to succeed
- Organisations must extend risk management to include risk resiliency
	- Enables organisations to manage, response and withstand the impact of activity in cyberspace

### Multi-Pronged Response Needed
- Cyber resilience requires recognition that organisations must prepare now to deal with severe impacts from cyber threats that cannot be predicted or prevented
- Requires high levels of partnering and collaboration, including external and internal collaborations
- Requires that organisations have the agility to prevent, detect and respond quickly and effectively not just to incidents but also to the consequences of the incidents
	- Good governance
	- Nimble to IT and Information Security responses
	- Up-to-date and well-tested public relations policies with key issues decided in advance
	- Crisis preparedness
	- Human relations responses
	- Investigative and forensic capability
	- Ability to share information
	- Legal responses

## Three Components of Cyber Resiliency
### Resilience
- Capability of an organisation to continue its minimum BC objective (MBCO) if not immediately then very quickly when it has suffer from a disaster or crisis
- The ability of an organisation to absorb the impact due to risk occurrence and to continue to operate in such a way as to achieve its MBCO
- The ability of an organisation to resist being affected by an incident

### MBCO
- Minimum level of service and/or products that is acceptable to the organisation to achieve its business objectives during an incident, emergency or disaster
- Set by the Executive Management of the organisation and can be influenced by current regulatory requirements or industry practices
- The management specification of what this level should be from a policy perspective

### BC
- Capability of the organisation to continue delivery of products or services at acceptable predefined levels following a disruptive incident

## Event/Crisis Level/Severity
> Crisis is a situation where organisations shift from routine to non-routine operations
- Management is required to divert a proportion of their attention, time, energy and resources away from normal operations to managing this event.
- Events or incidents may turn out to be non-issues and life goes on
- An incident or issue may be resolved easily without escalation or leading to a problem or disaster
- A problem can be declared a disaster if it failed to be resolved or meet certain requirements within a stated time limit
- As an event escalates, additional resources and authorization will be deployed

### Crisis/Event Levels
| Level    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Event    | Occurrence or change of a particular set of circumstances                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Incident | Occurrence by change or due to combination of unforeseen circumstances which if not handled in an appropriate manner can escalate into a disaster                                                                                |
| Disaster | Sudden, unplanned calamitous event that causes great damage or serious loss to an organisation resulting in an organisation failing to provide Critical Business Functions (CBFs) for some pre-determined minimum period of time |

- **Balancing the number of crisis/events levels**
	- Too many: cognitive overload in determining crisis/event level versus managing the incident
	- Too little: inappropriate level of response to perceived incident

### Crisis/Event Level Escalation
- <u>Three Determining Factors of Crisis/Event Level</u>
	- Business Functions (BFs) and/or assets affected
	- Time
	- Resources Needed
- <u>Criteria for Crisis/Event Level Escalation</u>
	- Criticality of and impact to the business function and asset
	- Pre-defined time to fix
	- Resources and/or authorization required to fix

## BC Policy Strategy
- Identifies potential impacts to BFs and/or assets
- Create a framework for resilience and response capabilities
- Safeguard interests of key stakeholders

### BC Planning (BCP)
- Process of developing prior arrangements and procedures that enable an organisation to response to an event in such a manner that CBFs can continue within planned levels of disruption
- **Domains addressed:**
	- Continuation of CBFs and critical processes when a high severity event destroys business services and/or data processing capabilities
	- Preparation, Testing and Maintenance of specific actions to recover to normal processing
- **Objectives**
	- End result of BCP is the BC Plan
	- Create a document, test and update the plan that will:
		- Allow timely recovery of CBFs
		- Minimise loss
		- Meet legal, regulatory and contractual requirements

### BC Plan
- Comprises clearly of defined and documented procedures and information for use when a disaster occurs
- Guide organisations to reduce, respond, recover, resume, restore and return to full recovery
- Covers key personnel, resources, services and actions required to ensure CBFs can continue within planned levels of disruption
- An ongoing process supported by senior management and funded to ensure that the necessary steps are taken to identify the impact of potential losses, maintain viable recovery strategies and plans and ensure the continuity of operations through personnel training, plan testing and maintenance
- **Scope**
	- All aspects of the organisation
	- Networks, power, personnel
	- Distributed operations

### BC Management (BCM) and Lifecycle

- An organisation-wide discipline and a holistic management process that identifies potential impacts to an organisation and impacts to business operations that those threats might cause
- Provides a framework for building organisational resilience with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interest of its key stakeholders, reputation, brand and value-creating activities

### BCP Phases
#### Project Management and Initiation
- Get management support
- Establish team (functional, technical, BC coordinator)
- Create a work plan (scope, goals, methods, timeline)
- Establish needs (risk analysis)
- Initial report to Management
- Obtain Management approval to proceed

#### Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
- **Goal**
	- Obtain formal agreement with senior management on the MBCO, Maximum Tolerable downtime for each time-critical business function
- Quantifies loss due to business outage (financial, extra cost of recovery, embarrassment)
- Does not estimate the probability of the kinds of incidents, only quantifies the consequences
- **Phases**
	- Choose information gathering methods (surveys, interviews, software tools)
	- Select interviewees
	- Customize questionnaire
	- Analyse inforamtion
	- Identify time-critical business functions
	- Assignment of MBCO and MTD
	- Rank CBFs by MBCO and MTDs
	- Report recovery options
	- Obtain management approval
- **Classifications of Systems**
	- To examine and
