## Key Considerations for Cybersecurity Assets
- **Business Data**
	- Business and Operations Plans
	- Financial Information
	- Transactions
	- Communications
	- Logistical Information
	- Manufacturing and Inventory Information
	- Archives and Records
	- Intellectual Properties
	- Research and Discoveries
	- Other Trade Secrets
- Personal Data
- Public Data
- Systems
- Services

## States of Data
- Data At Rest
- Data In Motion
- Data In Use

## Data Life Cycle and Key Data Functions
- Create
- Store
- Use
- Share
- Archive
- Destroy

## Data Security Considerations
- At what stages in each life cycle can data move between locations?
- How does data move between locations?
- What is/are the potential locations for data I have to protect?
- Who are the actors that potentially have access to the data I need to protect?
- Where are these actors coming from?
- What are the controls in each of those locations?

## Components of Data Security
- Data Labelling
	- Unclassified, Restricted, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret
- Data Handling
- Data Processing
- Data Security/Protection

## Cybersecurity Threats to Data
- Unauthorised Access
- Unauthorised Usage
- Theft or Accidental Loss of Storage Media
- Data Leakage
- Unauthorised Modification
- Destruction of Data
- Distributed Denial of Service
- Malware
- Improper Treatment or Sanitization after End-Of-Use

## Basic Data Protection Mechanisms
- Securing the electronic devices and applications
- Encryption
- Authentication
- Access Control
- <u>Physical Protection</u>
	- Network Segmentation
	- Defence-In-Depth
	- Physical Locking and Storage
	- Disconnect from Internet
- File and Database Accessing Monitoring
- Data Leakage Prevention (DLP)
- <u>Data Sanitization</u>
	- Anonymisation
	- Obfuscation
	- Tokenisation
	- Masking

## Secure Deletion of Data
- Low-level deletion/formatting
- Degaussing
- Physical Destruction
- Crypto-Shredding (1-Way Encryption)

## Challenges and Recommendations
- **Business Challenges**
	- Expensive
	- Need more resources to manage (e.g. security administrators)
	- Need additional hardware/software and processing capabilities
- **Solution Challenges**
	- Legacy Application Changes
	- Application Integration
	- Performance Issues
	- Key Management for Encryption
- **Recommendations**
	- Trade-off between security and performance
	- Apply appropriate security strategy keeping performance and data flow in mind
	- Separation of environment

## Personal Data Protection
- Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in Singapore
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe
- **Problems**
	- Huge amount of data about you can be stored on computer and easily searched
	- Data can be lost, stolen or transferred to another country easily
	- People need protection from careless or inaccurate processing of data about them

### Personal Data
| Data                                      | Description                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Personally Identifiable Information (PII) | NIST: Any information about an individual that can be used to trace one's identity or linked to an individual |
| Personal Data (PD)                        | GDPR: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person                                |

### PDPA
- Ensures that organisations taking care of personal data understand their possession or their control
- **Restrictions:**
	- Collection or Use of Personal Data
- **Components**
	- Do Not Call (DNC) - Privacy
	- Personal Data Protection
- Data Management

### Personal Data Protection Through Management and Governance
- Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO)
- Review Personal Data Inventory
- Ensure Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection Policies, Standards, Guidelines and Procedure
- Communicate internally
- Establish an Internal Audit Policy

### External Auditor vs PDPA
- If external auditor is processing personal data on behalf of and for the purposes of the company and this is done pursuant to a contract that is evidenced or made in writing, the external auditor may be a Data Intermediary for the purposes of PDPA that can benefit from the partial exclusion under Section 4(2) subject to fewer Data Protection obligations

## Cybersecurity Threats to Electronic Personal Data
- Hacking or other unauthorised access of databases
- Physical attacks
- Malware or hostile programs
- Social Engineering
- Unauthorised access or misuse of personal data by employers or vendors
- Loss of theft of electronic devices or portable storage devices containing personal data
-
