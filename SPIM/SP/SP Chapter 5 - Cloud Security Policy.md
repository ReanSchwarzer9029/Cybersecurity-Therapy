## Cloud Computing
- Shared/Outsourced assets, resources and services
	- Off-premise
	- Applications, data, etc., sit on other people's' infrastructure
	- Pay-as-you-go
		- Operational Expenditure rather than Capital Expenditure
	- Cost-saving
		- Less staff required
- Flexible, scalable on-demand and infrastructure supply
	- No need to purchase own assets and infrastructure
	- Excellent for storage and backup of data, application-hosting, etc.
	- Quick provisioning for users (servers, disk space, etc.)
	- Good for Business Continuity (BC) and Disaster Recovery (DR)
	- <u>Cloud Service Models</u>
		- Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)
		- Platform-as-a-service (PaaS)
		- Software-as-a-service (SaaS)

## 5 Essential Characteristics
- NIST SP-800-145 Definition of Cloud Computing:
	- On-Demand Self-Service
	- Broad Network Access
	- Resource Pooling
	- Rapid Elasticity
	- Measured Service

## Drives for Cloud Adoption
- Cost Management (OPEX vs CAPEX)
- Risk Reduction (e.g. Testing before commitment)
- Elasticity (Consumption-based Pricing)
- Business Agility and Mobility
- Focus on Core Business
- Business Continuity
- Collaboration and Innovation Platform
- Green IT
- Simplicity, Expandability and Elasticity

## Cloud Service Models
### Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)


### Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
- Also known as <u>cloud application services</u>
- Uses the internet to deliver applications managed by third-party vendors
- Hosted on a remote server
- Accessible over the Internet
- 

### Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
