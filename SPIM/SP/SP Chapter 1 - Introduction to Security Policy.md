## Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)

| A comprehensive and systematic approach to a more proactive and holistic risk assessment                                                                    | A silver bullet to prevent risks from occurring                                     |
| Provides a common lexicon of risk terminology and provides direction and guidance for implementing ERM                                                      | Methodology or checklist of items that need to be completed that guarantees results |
| Requires that organisations examine their complete portfolio of risks and consider how those risk interrelate                                               | The only way an organisation can take a more proactive approach to managing risks   |
| Requires that management develops an appropriate risk mitigation approach in a manner that is consistent with the organisation's strategy and risk appetite |                                                                                     |

## ISO 31000 - Risk Management
- Provides a universally recognised paradigm for practitioners and companies employing risk management processes across different industries, subject matters and regions

## Wicked Problem
- A problem that is difficult to define and has other complicating characteristics that inhibit overarching insights and silver bullet solutions
- Difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognise
- Complex interdependencies and the effort to solve one aspect of a wick problem may reveal or create other problems

## Security Policies
- **Examples of policies:**
	- Information Classification Security Policy
	- Acceptable Use Policy
	- Network Security Policy
	- Wireless Security Policy
	- Remote Access Policy
	- Web Security Policy
	- Software Security Policy
	- Extranet Policy
	- Access Control Policy
	- Authentication Policy
	- Email Security Policy
	- Security Awareness Policy
	- Incident Management Policy
	- Business Continuity and Disaster Contingency Policy
- **Compliance Hierarchy and Other Considerations**
	- Common Law
	- Law of the Land
	- Protocol
	- Policy
	- Procedure
	- Process
	- Blueprint
	- Framework and Methodology
	- Guideline and Best Practices
	- Plan
	- Standards
	- Principles
- 1-3 are beyond organisational control
- 5-12 are not mandatory

> - Focuses on why and what to do and doing the right things
> 	- rather than how to do and doing things right
> - Comes in the form of a document:
> 	- Formal structure
> 	- Can be in electronic format

- A **policy** is a course or principle of actions adopted or proposed by an organisation or individual
- A set of ideas or a plan of what to do in a particular situation that has been agreed to officially by a group of people, an organisation, a government or a political party
- Principles, rules and guidelines formulated or adopted by an organisation to reach its long-term goals and typically published in a booklet or other forms that is widely accessible
- Plan or course of action as a government, political group, business or other organisation intended to influence and determine decisions, actions and other matters

### Information Security Policy
- Set of mechanisms by which an organisation's information system security objectives can be defined and attained
- Information Security Policy Document - a document that states how an organisation plans to protect the organisation's assets
- A formal belief and high-level statement or plan that embraces an organisation's beliefs, goals, objectives and acceptable procedures for specific subject area
- Policy sets out an organisation's aims, principles and approach and specifies what is required to be achieved or delivered without prescribing how it should be carried out
- Policy requirements are usually expressed in simple single statement format or limited to short paragraphs comprising of a few statements


### Policy Breakdown (Compliance Paradox)
- Spirit of the Law vs Letter of the Law
- When a situation occurs and the policy does not know how to deal with it or ends up with inefficiency and causing other problems

### Non-Compliance
- Not the same as policy breakdown/compliance paradox
- Rule by exception
- Revisit  policies if there are too many exceptions

### Soft Components of a Policy
| Component  | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Philosophy | Organisation's approach towards information security<br>Big umbrella under which all other security mechanisms should fall                                                          |
| Strategy   | Plan or project plan of security philosophy detailing how the organisation intends to achieve the objectives that are laid out either implicitly or explicitly within the framework |

### Second Nature to Risk Management
- Integrated documented management system needs to be an integral part of the organisation's day-to-day operations
- When the management system becomes second nature within the business activities, minimises the frequency of dealing with surprises

### 4 Key Components of a Security Policy and Manual Framework
#### Policy
- What behaviour are we trying to govern?

#### Standards
- Specifies minimum requirements in a policy
- What are the responsibilities that each individual must meet for compliance

#### Guidelines
- Suggestions for best ways to accomplish a task
- Help to conform to a standard
- What are the general requirements for individual or devices to be compliant with the policy

#### Procedures
- A method by which a policy is accomplished
- Instruction to carry out a policy
- Focus on actions and steps
- What are the general technical requirements for individuals or devices to be compliant with the policy?

### Process vs Procedure
| Process                                                                                                                                                   | Procedure                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Set of activities or tasks with defined outcomes, deliverables and evaluation criteria to fulfil the requirements of certain policy or part of it thereof | Sequence of small tasks or detailed steps taken to accomplish a certain process or a particular goal |

## Requirement Levels Lexicon

	- But the implications must be understood and carefully weighted before choosing a different course
- Should Not or Not Recommended
	- There may exist particular circumstances when the particular behaviour is acceptable or even useful
	- But the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behaviour described with this label
- May or Optional
	- An item is truly optional
