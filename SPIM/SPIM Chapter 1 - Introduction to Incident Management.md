## Key Definitions
### Incident
- Unplanned interruption to an IT service
- Reduction in the quality of an IT service
- Failure of a C that has not yet impacted an IT service

### Service Request 
- Formal request for user for something to be provided
- **Examples:**
	- Request for information or advice, to reset a password or to install a workstation for a new user

### Workaround
- Method of bypassing an incident or problem
- **Temporary fix**
- Not a permanent solution but something that is used to get the service up and running until the real solution is found

## Life Cycles of Incidents
- Open
- In progress
- Resolved
- Closed
- Pending

## Purpose and Objectives
- **Purpose**
	- To restore normal service operation as quickly as possible
	- Minimize the adverse impacts on business
	- Ensuring the best levels of service quality and availability are maintained according to SLA's'
- **Objectives**
	- Standardized methods and procedures
	- Increased visibility and better communication
	- Priorities aligned with business
	- User satisfaction with the quality of IT services

## Value to Business
- Reducing service downtime
- Reducing incident impact to business
- Aligning IT to business priority
- Identify possible improvements to service
- Identification of additional requirements as a result of handling multiple incidents

## Incident Priority
- Ensures that support groups will pay required attention to the incident **based on the urgency and impact**

>**Impact + Urgency = Priority**

### Timescales
- Must be agreed for all incident-handling stages
- Based on the overall incident response and resolution targets within SLAs
- Captured as targets within OLAs and Underpinning Contracts (UCs)
- Support Groups should be made aware of these timescales
- Service Management tools automate and escalate as required
- Use **priority coding system**

## Major Incidents
> **Major Incident = High Impact + High Urgency

- Highest category of impact for an incident
- Results in significant distribution to a business
- Should have a <u>separate procedure</u>
	- Shorter timescales and greater urgency
	- Separate major incident team under the direct leadership of the incident manager
	- Informing management and Customer
	- Service Desk ensures all activities are recorded and users are kept fully informed of progress

## Functional and Hierarchical Escalation
> **Escalation** is the mechanism that assists timely resolution of an incident

### Functional Escalation
- Involving more specialist personnel or access privileges to solve the incident
- Departmental boundaries may be exceeded

### Hierarchical Escalation
- Can take place at any moment during resolution
- **Reasons:**
	- SLA threat
	- Extra resources required
	- Need to information higher management

## Standard Incident Models
- Designed and implemented for handling standard incident more efficiently
- Incident Model should include the following:
	- Steps required to handle the incident and their order
	- Responsibilities
	- Timescales and thresholds for completion
	- Any escalation procedure
	- Any evidence prevention activities

> Support tools can be used to automate the handling of standard incidents

### Incident Identification
**Triggers:**
- Incidents from:
	- Event management
	- Web interface
	- Users
	- Suppliers
	- Technical staff

### Incident Logging
- All incidents must be:
	- Fully logged
		- Date
		- Time
		- Owner
		- Contact
	- Date and timestamped
	- Full historical record of all incidents must be maintained
	- Opportunity fixes must also be logged
	- When incident is logged, resolution time count starts

### Incident Categorization
- Indicates the type of incident being logged
- Category is related to a team that will handle the incident from the Service Desk
- Categories are multi-level
	- **Hardware**
		- Server
		- Memory Board
		- Card Failure
	- **Software**
		- Application
		- Finance
		- Purchase Order System

### Service Request
- If category is a service request, it will be transferred to the **Request Fulfilment** process
- If not, transferred to the **Incident Prioritisation** process

### Incident Prioritization
- Determines how the incident will be handled by support staff and by support tools

### Major Incident
