## What is Malware?
> Short for **Malicious Software**

- Software with malicious intents to:
	- Disrupt computer operation
	- Gather sensitive information
	- Gain access to private computer systems

## Development in Malware Detection
### Malware is Named Inconsistently
- Antivirus companies use different names
- **Naming convention:** `<Malware Prefix>.<Malware Name>.<Malware Postfix>`
- **Causes of inconsistently named malware:**
	- Popular name in underground forums or used all by antivirus vendors
	- Different detection mechanisms (heuristic vs static analysis)
	- First name created by antivirus vendors persisted
	- Less prominent families are named independently by each vendor
- **Partial solutions:**
	- Use of *aliases field* (manually curated tables)
	- <u>Malheur</u>
		- Use of *automated clustering analysis*
			- Task of grouping set of objects in a way that objects in a cluster are more similar to each other than in other clusters
		- Discover possible aliases
			- Track evolution of malware family
			- Speeds up signature/remedy development
			- Speeds up construction of malware models on what the malware could do

### Antivirus Scanning
#### Signature-Based Scanning
- Efficient
- Requires frequent update of signatures
- Malware author or malware engine may mutate or encrypt the code
- Unable to detect zero-day malware

#### Heuristic-Based Analysis
- Uses **rules** to detect malicious behaviour when:
	- Program tries to copy itself
	- Program tries to remain resident after finished
	- Program decrypts itself when run
	- Program binds to TCP/IP port to listen to commands
- Uses **Trace Through Instructions** in a program before sending to the CPU
	- Includes `.COM`, `.EXE`, packets, processes and structures in memory
	- Examine changes made to the virtual environment

| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Can be used together with a signature-based engine | More CPU resources required |
| Can detect future malware                          | fal                            |
