## What is Malware?
> Short for **Malicious Software**

- Software with malicious intents to:
	- Disrupt computer operation
	- Gather sensitive information
	- Gain access to private computer systems

## Development in Malware Detection
### Malware is Named Inconsistently
- Antivirus companies use different names
- **Naming convention:** `<Malware Prefix>.<Malware Name>.<Malware Postfix>`
- **Causes of inconsistently named malware:**
	- Popular name in underground forums or used all by antivirus vendors
	- Different detection mechanisms (heuristic vs static analysis)
	- First name created by antivirus vendors persisted
	- Less prominent families are named independently by each vendor
- **Partial solutions:**
	- Use of *aliases field* (manually curated tables)
	- <u>Malheur</u>
		- Use of *automated clustering analysis*
			- Task of grouping set of objects in a way that objects in a cluster are more similar to each other than in other clusters
		- Discover possible aliases
			- Track evolution of malware family
			- Speeds up signature/remedy development
			- Speeds up construction of malware models on what the malware could do
